  Production-ready IPFS gateway with X402 payments - Live at ipfs.openx402.ai
</Card>

### What It Does

This starter project implements a **paywall-protected IPFS gateway** that requires micropayments before serving content. It's a perfect example of monetizing infrastructure services with OpenX402.

### Key Features

- **IPFS Content Delivery**: Serve IPFS content through a custom gateway
- **X402 Payment Protection**: Require payment before delivering content
- **Base Network Integration**: Uses Base for fast, low-cost transactions
- **Express.js Backend**: Simple Node.js server architecture
- **Production Ready**: Already deployed and serving traffic

### Tech Stack

```
Backend:    Node.js + Express
Blockchain: Base (Ethereum L2)
Payment:    USDC via OpenX402
Storage:    IPFS
```

### Quick Start

Clone and run the IPFS gateway starter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openx402/x402-ipfs-starter-server
cd x402-ipfs-starter-server
npm install
npm start
```

### How It Works

1. **User requests IPFS content** from your gateway
2. **Server returns 402 Payment Required** with OpenX402 facilitator info
3. **User submits payment** via Base network
4. **Server verifies payment** with OpenX402
5. **Content is delivered** from IPFS

### Example Request Flow

```javascript
// 1. Initial request without payment
GET /ipfs/QmXxxx...

// Response: 402 Payment Required
{
  "error": "Payment required",
  "facilitator": "https://openx402.ai/base",
  "amount": "0.01",
  "network": "base"
}

// 2. Request with payment proof
GET /ipfs/QmXxxx...
X-402-Payment: <payment_proof>

// Response: 200 OK
<IPFS content delivered>
```

### Integration Example

Here's how the payment verification works:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/ipfs/:cid', async (req, res) => {
  const paymentProof = req.headers['x-402-payment'];

  // Check for payment
  if (!paymentProof) {
    return res.status(402).json({
      error: 'Payment required',
      facilitator: 'https://openx402.ai/base',
      amount: '0.01',
      network: 'base'
    });
  }

  // Verify payment with OpenX402
  const verification = await fetch('https://open.x402.host/verify', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      proof: paymentProof,
      network: 'base'
    })
  }).then(r => r.json());

  if (!verification.valid) {
    return res.status(402).json({ error: 'Invalid payment' });
  }

  // Payment verified - serve IPFS content
  const ipfsContent = await fetchFromIPFS(req.params.cid);
  res.send(ipfsContent);
});
```

</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

This starter project is ideal for:

- **IPFS Gateway Operators**: Monetize your gateway without subscriptions
- **Content Delivery Networks**: Add pay-per-request to your CDN
- **API Providers**: Implement usage-based pricing for your APIs
- **Data Services**: Charge for database queries or analytics endpoints

## Customization

The starter is designed to be easily customized:

### Change Payment Amount

```javascript
// Adjust the price in your route handler
amount: '0.01' // Change to your desired USDC amount
```

### Switch Networks

```javascript
// Use a different blockchain
network: 'solana' // or 'polygon', 'bsc', 'xlayer'
facilitator: 'https://openx402.ai/solana'
```

### Add Custom Logic

```javascript
// Add your own business logic
if (verification.valid) {
  // Log analytics
  await logPayment(verification.transactionId);

  // Apply rate limiting
  await checkRateLimit(req.ip);

  // Deliver content
  return serveContent();
}
```

## Deployment

The starter includes everything you need to deploy:

- **Docker support** for containerized deployment
- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring
- **Production logging** with request tracking

### Deploy to Your Server

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run start:production

# Or use Docker
docker build -t x402-ipfs-gateway .
docker run -p 3000:3000 x402-ipfs-gateway
```
