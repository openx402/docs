## Overview

OpenX402 enables a new class of applications where services are monetized through micropayments instead of subscriptions or API keys. Here are real-world use cases you can build today.

## AI Agents & Autonomous Services

### Data Feed Purchases

AI agents can autonomously purchase real-time data without human intervention:

```python
# AI agent buying market data
response = requests.post(
    "https://market-data.example.com/prices",
    headers={"X-402-Payment": payment_payload}
)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Real-time price feeds for trading bots
- Weather data for logistics optimization
- News feeds for sentiment analysis
- Social media trends for marketing AI

### Computational Services

Enable AI models to purchase compute resources on-demand:

- **GPU time** for model training
- **API calls** to other AI services
- **Storage** for training data
- **Inference** from specialized models

## Paywalled APIs

### No API Keys Required

Build APIs that accept payments instead of managing authentication:

```javascript
// Traditional approach
app.get('/premium-data', authenticateAPIKey, (req, res) => {
  // Check subscription tier
  // Rate limit based on plan
});

// OpenX402 approach
app.get('/premium-data', verifyPayment, (req, res) => {
  // Payment verified, serve data
});
```

**Benefits:**
- No user registration or accounts
- No API key management
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Instant monetization

### Usage-Based Pricing

Perfect for services with variable usage:

| Service Type | Traditional Model | OpenX402 Model |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Image API | $49/month for 10k requests | $0.005 per request |
| Data Scraping | $199/month unlimited | $0.01 per scrape |
| Translation | $99/month for 1M chars | $0.0001 per character |

## Identity-Gated Content

### NFT-Gated Endpoints

Combine payment verification with NFT ownership:

```typescript
// Endpoint requires both payment AND NFT ownership
app.post('/exclusive-content', async (req, res) => {
  const paymentValid = await verifyOpenX402Payment(req);
  const ownsNFT = await checkNFTOwnership(req.wallet);

  if (paymentValid && ownsNFT) {
    return res.json({ content: "..." });
  }
});
```

**Applications:**
- Member-only content with micropayments
- Tiered access based on NFT rarity
- Community resources with usage fees

## Proxy Services

### Decentralized API Aggregation

Build proxy services that aggregate multiple APIs:

```
User → OpenX402 Payment → Your Proxy → Multiple APIs
```

**Example: Weather Aggregator**
- User pays $0.01 to your proxy
- Proxy queries 5 different weather APIs
- Returns aggregated, verified data
- You keep the margin

## Autonomous Marketplaces

### Bot-to-Bot Commerce

Enable bots to buy and sell services automatically:

**Example: Data Marketplace**
1. Bot A lists dataset for $5
2. Bot B discovers listing
3. Bot B pays via OpenX402
4. Bot A automatically releases data
5. No human intervention required

## Analytics & Insights

### Pay-Per-Query Analytics

Monetize data analytics without subscriptions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://analytics.example.com/query \
  -H "X-402-Payment: $PAYMENT_PROOF" \
  -d '{"metric": "user_retention", "period": "30d"}'
```

**Use Cases:**
- Business intelligence queries
- Market research data
- Competitive analysis
- Custom reports

## Developer Tools

### Code Execution Services

Pay-per-execution for serverless functions:

- **Code playgrounds** that charge per run
- **CI/CD pipelines** with usage-based billing
- **Build services** that scale with usage
- **Testing platforms** with micropayment tiers

## Content Delivery

### Paywalled Media

Monetize content without platforms taking a cut:

- **Articles** - $0.10 per read
- **Videos** - $0.25 per stream
- **Music** - $0.05 per play
- **E-books** - $2.00 per download

No middleman, instant settlement, global access.
