## What is OpenX402?

OpenX402 is the **first open x402 facilitator** that enables any server to accept micropayments without API keys or KYC requirements. Built for the next generation of autonomous systems, OpenX402 bridges the friction between today's web protocols and tomorrow's agent-to-agent economies.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional payment systems weren't built for autonomous agents and programmatic services. They require:
- API keys and authentication
- KYC/identity verification
- Custodial accounts
- Complex integration processes

**OpenX402 removes these barriers**, enabling:
- **Direct agent-to-agent transactions** without intermediaries
- **Instant micropayments** for API access and services
- **Usage-based monetization** without custodial requirements
- **HTTP-based payments** that work anywhere
