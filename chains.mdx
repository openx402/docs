  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Base (Primary Facilitator)

Base is our **primary facilitator** and the recommended choice for most applications.

### Key Details

- **Network**: Base (Ethereum L2)
- **Facilitator URL**: `https://open.x402.host`
- **Transaction Cost**: Low (< $0.01 per transaction)
- **Settlement Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Status**: Production

### Why Base?

- **Security**: Inherits Ethereum's security guarantees
- **Cost-Effective**: Significantly cheaper than Ethereum mainnet
- **Ecosystem**: Large DeFi ecosystem and liquidity
- **Developer Experience**: Full EVM compatibility

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| `/open` | Production gateway | $1 USDC |
| `/test` | Development testing | $0.0001 USDC |
| `/verify` | Payment verification | Free |
| `/settle` | Settlement finalization | Free |
| `/supported` | List networks | Free |

### Example Integration

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://open.x402.host/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    transactionHash: '0x...',
    network: 'base'
  })
});
```

## X Layer

X Layer is OKX's high-performance Layer-2 solution, now live on mainnet.

### Key Details

- **Network**: X Layer (OKX L2)
- **Facilitator URL**: Coming soon
- **Transaction Cost**: Ultra-low
- **Settlement Time**: < 1 second
- **Status**: Mainnet Live

### Why X Layer?

- **Speed**: Near-instant finality
- **Cost**: Among the cheapest L2 options
- **OKX Ecosystem**: Direct integration with OKX exchange

### Best For

- High-frequency trading bots
- Real-time data feeds
- Gaming microtransactions
- High-volume API services

## Solana

Solana offers the fastest transaction speeds, ideal for high-frequency use cases.

### Key Details

- **Network**: Solana
- **Facilitator URL**: In development
- **Transaction Cost**: ~$0.00025 per transaction
- **Settlement Time**: < 500ms
- **Status**: Coming Soon

### Why Solana?

- **Ultra-Fast**: Sub-second transaction finality
- **Cost-Effective**: Lowest transaction fees
- **Parallel Processing**: Can handle 65,000+ TPS
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Expanding DeFi and NFT markets

### Best For

- High-frequency bot operations
- Real-time streaming payments
- Gaming and metaverse applications
- Consumer-facing microtransactions

## Choosing the Right Chain

<Accordion title="Cost-Sensitive Applications">
  **Recommended: Solana** (when available) or **X Layer**

  For applications where every fraction of a cent matters, these chains offer the lowest fees.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security-First Applications">
  **Recommended: Base**

  For applications where security is paramount, Base provides Ethereum-level security at L2 costs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="High-Frequency Trading">
  **Recommended: Solana** or **X Layer**

  For bots making hundreds of transactions per second, speed is critical.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="General Purpose">
  **Recommended: Base**

  For most applications, Base offers the best balance of cost, security, and ecosystem support.
</Accordion>

## Network Comparison

| Feature | Base | X Layer | Solana |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **Settlement Time** | ~2s | &lt;1s | &lt;500ms |
| **Transaction Cost** | ~$0.01 | ~$0.001 | ~$0.0003 |
| **Security Model** | Ethereum L2 | Ethereum L2 | Proof of Stake |
| **TPS** | ~1,000 | ~5,000 | 65,000+ |
| **Status** | ✅ Production | ✅ Mainnet | 🔄 Coming Soon |
| **Best For** | General use | High volume | Ultra-fast |

## Getting Started

### 1. Check Network Availability

```bash
curl https://open.x402.host/supported
```

### 2. Choose Your Network

Select based on your requirements:
- **Base** for most applications
- **X Layer** for high volume
- **Solana** for maximum speed (coming soon)

### 3. Integrate

Follow our [quickstart guide](/quickstart) with your chosen network.

## Multi-Chain Strategy

Many applications benefit from **supporting multiple chains**:

```javascript
// Support multiple networks
const networks = ['base', 'xlayer', 'solana'];

async function processPayment(network, tx) {
  const facilitator = getFacilitatorForNetwork(network);
  return await facilitator.verify(tx);
}
```

### Benefits

- **User Choice**: Let users pay with their preferred chain
- **Redundancy**: Fallback if one network has issues
- **Cost Optimization**: Route to cheapest network dynamically
- **Geographic Optimization**: Different chains have different regional strengths

## Upcoming Networks

We're constantly expanding chain support. Networks under consideration:

- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- BSC
